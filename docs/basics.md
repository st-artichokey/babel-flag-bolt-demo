## Slack Platform

### Adding your slack workspace to your app

In terminal, run `slack login`. This will give you the prompt and permissions to add it to your workspace. Copy that slash command (with token) and run it in any Slack channel or DM in your workspace. This will give you a challenge code that you'll take back to your terminal and enter. 

You will need permissions to add this auth to your workspace so make sure you have those!
