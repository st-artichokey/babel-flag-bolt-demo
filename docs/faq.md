## What is this repo for?
This repo is designed to walk you through, step by step, creating and installing a translator Slack app. 

## Wait doesn’t Slack already have a translate feature?

Yes! And this repo is not intended to be a replacement for that feature. 

However, in addition to the walkthrough, it also has a pretty good setup for a Bolt AI app. It also has some files that should give you a pretty good starting point for building your own AI powered app and/or an emoji-react app.


## What else can I use this code for?
Anything that requires an emoji response. It doesn’t have to be hooked up to a translation API. You can also use parts of it to start a workflow of your own design, or even interact with other integrations. For example, you could build an react to start an incident workflow that Slack builders and users can update without needing to get into the code.
